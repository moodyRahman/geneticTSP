You can put your best paths here, or in any other CSV-type file.
Netlogo will read your file looking for the particular dataset name on a line by itself (like A4 or A11), followed by a line containing the path with point 0
at the beginning.  For instance, the following are the optimal paths for A4 and A8.

A4
0,2,1,3

A8
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

A9
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
